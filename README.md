# Job Dispatcher for ds-sim

### Joshua Santos, 45203083

This is the code for Stage 2 of the COMP3100 major project, S1, 2023. The aim of stage 2 is to design and implement a custom algorithm that optimises average turnaround time. This algorithm is implemented in the ds-client developed from stage 1. More information on ds-client and ds-server can be found [here](https://github.com/distsys-MQ/ds-sim).

## Running the Stage 2 Test Suite

1. Clone this repository.
2. Take the .jar file and put it into the S2Demo folder.
3. Add ds-server and ds-client to the same folder.
4. Open the terminal and enter:
```
python3 ./s2_demo.py "java -jar client.jar" -n
```
