# Job Dispatcher for ds-sim

### Joshua Santos, 45203083

This is the code for Stage 1 of the COMP3100 major project, S1, 2023. The aim of stage 1 is to design and implement a vanilla version of "ds-client", one of the components of ds-sim which can be found [here](https://github.com/distsys-MQ/ds-sim).

## Running the Demo
Running the demo given during the week 6 workshop involves:
1. Making sure that ds-client and ds-server are in the "classes" folder.
2. Unzipping "week06.tar".
3. Taking the contents of the resulting week06 folder (S1testConfigs and S1Tests-wk6.sh) and placing them into the "classes" folder".
3. Opening the linux terminal and changing directories to the "classes" folder.
4. Executing S1Tests-wk6.sh with these arguments: 
    * ./S1Tests-wk6.sh Main.class -n
